\section{Contacts}
This section introduces collision detection and handling in DART. We
will simulate three cubes and the ground and visualize their motion
due to collisions. We follow the same Glut framework described in the
previous section, but in this example we allow the user to apply
forces to interact one of the cubes. We also add playback
functionality so the user can replay the simulation result.

\subsection{Simulation step}

- immobile state

\subsection{Contact dynamics}

- contact parameters
