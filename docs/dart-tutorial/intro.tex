\section{Introduction}
- generalized coordinates
- support LCP contact modeling
- access to dynamic state such as mass matrix, coriolis and
centrifugal forces, Jacobian matrices, transformation matrices
- assemble arbitrary Jacobian matrices
- support arbitrary mesh representation
- supper ball joints, hinge joints, universal joints
- support RK1 and RK4
