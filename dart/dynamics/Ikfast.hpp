// - Lookat3D - direction on end effector coordinate system points to desired 3D position
// - TranslationDirection5D - end effector origin and direction reaches desired 3D translation and direction. Can be thought of as Ray IK where the origin of the ray must coincide.
// - TranslationXY2D - end effector origin reaches desired XY translation position, Z is ignored. The coordinate system with relative to the base link.
// - TranslationLocalGlobal6D - local point on end effector origin reaches desired 3D global point. Because both local point and global point can be specified, there are 6 values.
// - TranslationXAxisAngle4D, TranslationYAxisAngle4D, TranslationZAxisAngle4D - end effector origin reaches desired 3D translation, manipulator direction makes a specific angle with x/y/z-axis (defined in the manipulator base linkâ€™s coordinate system)
